#This Dockerfile snippet is used to create a Docker image for running a Java web application using Apache Tomcat. Let's break down each part of it:

#FROM tomcat:8.0.51-jre8-alpine

#This line specifies the base image for your Docker image. In this case, it's using the official Tomcat image with the tag 8.0.51-jre8-alpine. This image is based on Alpine Linux, a lightweight Linux distribution.
#EXPOSE 8080

#This line indicates that the container will expose port 8080. It doesn't actually publish the port to the host; it's more like a declaration that the container will use this port internally.
#RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*

#This line runs a shell command within the Docker image during the build process. It removes all files and directories inside the /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ directory. This step is often used to clean up any existing web applications that might be present in the default Tomcat deployment.
#COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

#This line copies the *.war file(s) from the target directory of your project (assuming that's where your application's .war file is generated) into the /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ directory of the Docker image. It renames the .war file to ROOT.war, which means your application will be available at the root context of the Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080/).
#CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

#This line specifies the command to run when the container is started. In this case, it runs Tomcat using the catalina.sh script with the run argument. This starts Tomcat and makes your web application accessible.
#When you build and run a container from this Docker image, it will start Tomcat and deploy your Java web application, making it accessible on port 8080 within the container. You can map this container port to a host port if you want to access the web application from outside the container.
# Note - Yes, the /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ directory is present in the Docker image because it's part of the official Tomcat image that you are using as the base image (tomcat:8.0.51-jre8-alpine). This directory is the default location where Tomcat looks for web applications to deploy.
